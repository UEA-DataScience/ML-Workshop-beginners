    "Throughout this workshop you will be introduced to the fundamentals of Supervised Learning as a branch of Machine Learning. The topics covered in this workshop include:  \n",
    "- Data Preparaton\n",
    "- Interacting with 'Panel Data' or 'Pandas'\n",
    "- Building a classification model based on 'K - Nearest Neighbours' or KNN with the tools library [`SciKit-Learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",
    "- Developing a pipeline\n",
    "- Data Scaling  \n",
    "- Model Building: Logistic regression, Linear regression\n",
    "- Model Optimisation  \n",
    "\n",
    "To give you the opportunity to evaluate your understanding of the information presented a series of tasks are included for you to attempt as you progress through these notebooks. You are encouraged to attempt each task based upon the supporting materials.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The soltuions for each task can be found in the relevant task solution notebook e.g. for Task `01_tabular_data_exploration_ex_01.ipynb` the solutions can be found in `01_tabular_data_exploration_sols_01.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we look at the necessary steps required before any machine learning takes place. It involves:  \n",
    "* loading the data;\n",
    "* looking at the variables in the dataset, in particular, differentiate\n",
    "  between numerical and categorical variables, which need different\n",
    "  preprocessing in most machine learning workflows;\n",
    "* visualizing the distribution of the variables to gain some insights into the\n",
